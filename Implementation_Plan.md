# SHL Assessment Recommendation Engine Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for building a Recommendation Engine that uses SHL's product catalog to suggest appropriate assessments based on job roles and company requirements. The system leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to provide accurate and contextually relevant recommendations.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js for a responsive and modern UI
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) for data processing, scraping, and LLM integration
- **Vector Database**: Supabase with pgvector extension for semantic search
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- **Embedding Model**: text-embedding-ada-002 or similar
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Version Control**: Git

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Collection Strategy
- Use Python's Beautiful Soup or Scrapy to scrape SHL's website
- Target assessment descriptions, competency frameworks, and usage guidelines
- Store raw data in structured JSON format
- Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading the source website

### Embedding and Vector Search Implementation
- Text chunking: Split assessment descriptions into optimal chunks (150-200 tokens)
- Use OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 for generating embeddings
- Store embeddings in pgvector with appropriate indexing
- Implement cosine similarity search with optimization for efficient queries

### RAG Architecture Details
- Query understanding: Process user input to extract key requirements
- Retrieval: Find top-k (k=5-10) most relevant assessment descriptions
- Context formation: Combine retrieved information into a coherent context
- Generation: Use GPT-4 to generate recommendations with explanations
- Post-processing: Format output and validate references

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
- System message: Define the role as an SHL assessment expert
- Context insertion: Include retrieved assessment details
- Task definition: Clear instructions for generating recommendations
- Output formatting: Template for structured recommendations

### Frontend Components
- Job requirement input form with guided fields
- Company context input section
- Real-time recommendation display
- Explanation panels for each recommendation
- Filtering and sorting options for recommendations

## Evaluation Metrics

### Recommendation Quality
- Relevance score: Alignment with job requirements
- Explanation quality: Clarity and specificity of reasoning
- Diversity: Appropriate variety in recommended assessments

### System Performance
- Response time: <3 seconds for complete recommendations
- Retrieval precision: Accuracy of retrieved assessments
- System robustness: Handling of edge cases and unusual queries

## Future Enhancements
- Feedback loop implementation for continuous improvement
- Expansion to include more assessment types and products
- Integration with job description parsing tools
- Personalization based on company history and preferences
- Multi-modal support for different input types

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- LLM hallucinations: Mitigate with strict grounding in retrieved data
- Data freshness: Implement regular scraping updates
- API rate limits: Implement caching and request batching

### Project Risks
- Scope creep: Strictly prioritize core features for initial delivery
- Timeline constraints: Implement agile methodology with regular reviews
- Resource limitations: Focus on efficient algorithms and optimize early
