It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development  needs/limitations. \r\nThe extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions \r\nto enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have \r\ndemonstrated critical job behaviours. \r\n  \r\nThe PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and \r\ndevelopment situations.
